[OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py) is the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) version of the [OpenNMT](https://opennmt.net) project, an open-source (MIT) neural machine translation framework. It is designed to be research friendly to try out new ideas in translation, summary, morphology, and many other domains. Some companies have proven the code to be production ready.


The official documentation is available [here](https://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/).  
Our own modifications are documented on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/helsinki-nlp/OpenNMT-1e5ac49fe4c34225ae85d35598262ee0).  
If we have any release plans in the future, we could export Notion pages as markdown files or directly make the Notion page public.
