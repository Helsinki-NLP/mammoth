# ðŸ¦£ MAMMOTH: Massively Multilingual Modular Open Translation @ Helsinki
This repository contains the code for ðŸ¦£ MAMMOTH, the modular translation toolkit from Helsinki-NLP.

This library is built on top of OpenNMT-py.
[OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py) is the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) version of the [OpenNMT](https://opennmt.net) project, an open-source (MIT) neural machine translation framework. It is designed to be research friendly to try out new ideas in translation, summary, morphology, and many other domains. Some companies have proven the code to be production ready.

### Documentation
The original ONMT-py documentation is available [here](https://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/).  
Our own modifications (currently-under-development) are documented [here](https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/mammoth/).

FINAL NOTE: We would appreciate it A LOT if you report issues with this repo and/or the documentation 

### Acknowledgements
We thank the NVIDIA AI Technology Center Finland for their help with the multi-gpu/node implementation.
