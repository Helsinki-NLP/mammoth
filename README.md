[OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py) is the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) version of the [OpenNMT](https://opennmt.net) project, an open-source (MIT) neural machine translation framework. It is designed to be research friendly to try out new ideas in translation, summary, morphology, and many other domains. Some companies have proven the code to be production ready.


The official documentation is available [here](https://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/).  
Our own modifications are documented under `docs'. A preview is available https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/mammoth-docs.  
During development, we document our features under `docs` markdown. In the official release, we integrate docs into Actions.
