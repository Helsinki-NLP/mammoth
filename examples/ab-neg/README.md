This directory contains configuration files for our upcoming paper "_I Have an Attention Bridge to Sell you: Generalization Capabilities of Modular Translation Architectures_".

**Disclaimer:** Files are provided as-is so as to foster reproducible research. 
Experiments were conducted with the code provided on [the `ab-neg` branch](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/mammoth/tree/ab-neg).
While the configuration files provided here should be compatible with the main branch, they have not been extensively tested.

### Access to data
We experimented on a custom split of UNPC, which can be made available upon request. The corresponding data amounts to 284.265 GiB.
Experiments on OPUS-100 use the default split, available [here](https://opus.nlpl.eu/legacy/opus-100.php) among other places.
